Breakdown of the architecture into modular components, each described as  "Technology" items. These components ensure modularity, scalability, and reusability while avoiding a monolithic design.

### **Title:** Schema Management System  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** The system requires dynamic schemas to define object structures without database migrations. These schemas must ensure data integrity and flexibility for evolving use cases.  
**Problem Statement:** Frequent schema changes can disrupt dependent function calls and use cases. A robust management system is needed to handle schema definitions, enforce validation, and prevent disruptive changes.  
**Solution Idea:** Implement a schema management system that validates object data against dynamic schemas, tracks schema dependencies (e.g., function calls, use cases), and prevents breaking changes.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- Centralized schema repository with version control.  
- API endpoints to fetch, update, and manage schemas (`/api/objects/schemas`).  
- Validation logic to ensure data consistency.  
- Dependency tracking for object-node-paths used in function calls (`includedInFunctionCall`) and use cases (`includedInUseCase`).  
- UI for developers to register schema dependencies.  
- Integration with schema modification tools to block breaking changes.

### **Title:** Function Call Dependency Tracker  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** Function calls in AI use cases rely on specific object-node-paths. Changes to these paths can cause failures, requiring a dependency tracking mechanism.  
**Problem Statement:** There is no existing system to monitor and enforce the registration of object-node-paths used in function calls. This creates risks of unintentional disruptions.  
**Solution Idea:** Develop a tracker that registers object-node-paths used in function calls, provides visibility into these dependencies, and prevents schema changes that could break them.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- Event type `includedInFunctionCall` to track object-node-paths.  
- API endpoint (`/api/object/functionCalls/:object`) to expose all registered dependencies for a given object.  
- UI for developers to register and manage dependencies.  
- Integration with schema modification tools to block breaking changes.

### **Title:** Use Case Dependency Tracker  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** AI use cases depend on function calls, which in turn rely on object-node-paths. A system is needed to track these relationships and identify critical dependencies.  
**Problem Statement:** There is no visibility into how function calls and object-node-paths are linked to specific use cases, making it difficult to assess the impact of changes.  
**Solution Idea:** Create a tracker that registers function calls linked to use cases and exposes these relationships for monitoring and impact analysis.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- Event type `includedInUseCase` to track function call dependencies.  
- API endpoint (`/api/object/useCases/:functionCall`) to expose all use cases that rely on a given function call.  
- UI for monitoring, registering, and describing use case dependencies.  
- Integration with schema and function call tools to identify critical changes.

### **Title:** Dynamic Object API  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** The platform requires a flexible API to manage object data, perform CRUD operations, and support dynamic schemas.  
**Problem Statement:** Traditional APIs with rigid data structures cannot adapt to evolving use cases or dynamic schemas.  
**Solution Idea:** Implement a dynamic object API that supports flexible object management, validation against schemas, and efficient querying.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- CRUD endpoints for objects (`/api/objects/:objectType`).  
- Validation logic to enforce schema rules.  
- Full-text search and filtering capabilities (`/api/objects/:objectType/search`).  
- Pagination and field selection for efficient data retrieval.  
- Support for multi-select fields and nested structures.

### **Title:** Schema Validation and Enforcement Engine  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** Object data must conform to schema definitions to ensure data integrity and prevent inconsistencies.  
**Problem Statement:** Without validation, invalid data can lead to downstream failures in function calls and use cases.  
**Solution Idea:** Build a validation engine that checks object data against schema definitions and enforces constraints.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- Real-time validation during object creation and updates.  
- Support for complex constraints (e.g., required fields, enums, nested structures).  
- Integration with the dynamic object API and schema management system.  
- Error handling and detailed feedback for developers.

### **Title:** Authentication and Access Control Module  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** The system must ensure secure access to APIs while allowing role-based permissions for different users.  
**Problem Statement:** Unauthorized access to APIs or sensitive data could compromise the systemâ€™s security.  
**Solution Idea:** Implement a robust authentication and access control module using JWT tokens and role-based permissions.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints.  
- Role-based access control to restrict operations based on user roles.  
- Integration with schema and object APIs to enforce permissions.  

---

### **Title:** Event Notification and Monitoring System  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** Changes to schemas, function calls, or use cases can have cascading impacts. A notification system is required to alert stakeholders.  
**Problem Statement:** Lack of visibility into critical changes can lead to missed dependencies and failures.  
**Solution Idea:** Build an event notification system that tracks changes and alerts relevant stakeholders.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- Event types for schema changes, function call updates, and use case modifications.  
- Notification channels (e.g., email, Slack) for alerts.  
- Integration with dependency trackers to highlight critical impacts.  

---

### **Title:** Developer Tooling and UI for Dependency Management  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** Developers need tools to register, monitor, and manage dependencies between schemas, function calls, and use cases.  
**Problem Statement:** Manual tracking of dependencies is error-prone and inefficient.  
**Solution Idea:** Provide a developer-friendly UI for managing dependencies and monitoring impacts.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- UI for registering object-node-paths in function calls and use cases.  
- Visualization of dependency relationships.  
- Integration with APIs for schema modification and monitoring.

### **Title:** Payload Management and Optimization  
**Summary:**  
**Situation/Context:** Large datasets can impact API performance and usability. Payload size must be managed effectively.  
**Problem Statement:** Excessive payload sizes can lead to slow responses and inefficient data handling.  
**Solution Idea:** Implement strategies for payload management, including truncation, pagination, and field selection.  
**Detailed Design:**  
- Automatic truncation for large responses.  
- Pagination with configurable limits.  
- Field selection to retrieve only necessary data.

By breaking the architecture into these modular components, development can progress independently for each module, enabling parallel workstreams and reusability across different contexts. The modular design also ensures scalability and maintainability over time.
